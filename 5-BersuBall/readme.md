Using a recursive function called rec that accepts two parameters, i and j, to represent the current indices of boys and girls, respectively, I've employed a dynamic programming method with memoization. The function additionally requires a memoization table (dp), arrays a and b with the dance prowess of the boys and girls, and n and m with the total number of boys and girls. In the rec function, the function returns 0 if either i or j reaches the end of the boys' array an or the girls' array b. If not, it iteratively investigates every conceivable pair, taking into account the requirement that the partners' dancing abilities differ by no more than one. In order to prevent unnecessary computations, the memoization table dp saves previously computed findings. The code sorts the arrays a and b in a non-decreasing order and prints the final result ans, which reflects the maximum number of pairings that may be generated, after initializing ans with the result of rec(0, 0, n, m, a, b, dp). This method makes sure that the problem is solved efficiently by methodically examining every possible pairing and using memoization to maximize efficiency and prevent recalculating overlapping subproblems.
