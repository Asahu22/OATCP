Using dynamic programming for performance, the given C++ program determines the number of pathways from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid represented by a 2D vector of characters. In order to prevent unnecessary computations, it computes the pathways recursively and memoizes the results. With impediments indicated by a '*' and empty spaces by a '.', users input the grid's size and values. The application then reports the total number of paths found.

The application uses the recursive method (rec() function) to traverse the grid and determine how many pathways there are between each cell and the bottom-right corner. In order to maximize computation, it makes use of dynamic programming to store previously computed values in a memoization table (dp vector). It first determines whether the value for a cell has already been computed before computing pathways from that cell; if so, it reuses the stored value to avoid performing duplicate computations. Efficiency is greatly increased using this approach, especially for bigger grids. Following user input of the grid's size (n) and its actual contents (barriers denoted by '*' and empty spaces by '.'), the program returns the total number of pathways discovered. We welcome contributions for improvements, bug fixes, and optimizations to increase the functioning of the software.
